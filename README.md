# ü©∫ Multilingual Medical Q&A Chatbot

A specialized medical question-answering chatbot built using the [MedQuAD dataset](https://github.com/abachaa/MedQuAD), capable of understanding and responding to user queries in **English**, **Spanish**, **Hindi**, and **French**.

This project was developed in **two major phases**:

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Medical Q&A Chatbot using MedQuAD Dataset

- Built a domain-specific chatbot using the curated MedQuAD dataset containing thousands of medical questions and answers from trusted health sources like NIH.
- Implemented a **TF-IDF-based retrieval mechanism** to identify the most relevant medical answer based on user queries.
- Cleaned and normalized medical questions for better matching using `scikit-learn`, `regex`, and domain-aware preprocessing.
- Designed a simple yet functional frontend using **Streamlit** for users to ask questions and receive direct medical responses.
- Added basic recognition of medical entities such as symptoms, diseases, and treatments to ensure context-aware results.

## üåç Phase 2: Multilingual Support & Advanced Processing

- Extended the chatbot to support **four languages**: `English (en)`, `Spanish (es)`, `Hindi (hi)`, and `French (fr)`.
- Integrated **automatic language detection** using `langdetect`, enhanced with domain-specific medical keywords for accuracy.
- Implemented **dynamic translation pipeline** using `deep-translator` to:
  - Translate non-English queries to English before retrieval
  - Translate English answers back to the user's original language for a seamless experience
- Added **long-text translation chunking** support to avoid API limitations and ensure full answer translation.
- Enabled **real-time question processing and streaming UI** via Streamlit with session memory.
